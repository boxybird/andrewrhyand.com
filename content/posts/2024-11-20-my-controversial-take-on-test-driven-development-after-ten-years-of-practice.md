# My Take on TDD

After a decade of practicing TDD, I have opinions.

## What TDD Gets Right

- Forces you to think about design upfront
- Gives you confidence to refactor
- Documents expected behavior
- Catches regressions instantly

## What TDD Gets Wrong

- Not everything needs tests first
- Exploratory coding is valuable
- UI tests written before the UI exists are painful
- 100% coverage is a vanity metric

## My Approach Now

1. Write tests first for complex logic
2. Write tests after for simple CRUD
3. Skip tests for throwaway prototypes
4. Always test the critical path

## The Real Lesson

The goal is working software with confidence, not adherence to a methodology.
