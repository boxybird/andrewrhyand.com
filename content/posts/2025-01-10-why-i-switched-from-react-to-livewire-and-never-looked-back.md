# Why I Switched from React to Livewire

After five years of React, I was exhausted. The constant churn of state management libraries, build tool migrations, and breaking changes wore me down.

## The Breaking Point

When I spent three days debugging a hydration mismatch, I knew something had to change.

## Enter Livewire

Livewire gave me everything I needed:
- Real-time updates without writing JavaScript
- Server-side rendering by default
- No build step complexity

## The Result

My productivity doubled. My bundle size dropped to nearly zero. I sleep better at night.
