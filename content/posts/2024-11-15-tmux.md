# tmux

Split your terminal. Detach sessions. Never lose work to a disconnect.

## Essential Commands

```bash
# Start new session
tmux new -s myproject

# Detach
Ctrl-b d

# Reattach
tmux attach -t myproject

# Split horizontal
Ctrl-b "

# Split vertical
Ctrl-b %

# Navigate panes
Ctrl-b arrow-keys
```

## My Config

```bash
# Use Ctrl-a instead of Ctrl-b
set -g prefix C-a

# Start windows at 1, not 0
set -g base-index 1

# Mouse support
set -g mouse on
```

## Why Bother?

SSH into a server, start a long-running process in tmux, detach, go home, reattach. Magic.
