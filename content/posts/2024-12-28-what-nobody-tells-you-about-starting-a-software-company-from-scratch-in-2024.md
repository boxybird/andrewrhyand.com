# Starting a Software Company in 2024

The Twitter success stories don't show the full picture.

## The Reality

- You'll work more hours than any job
- Revenue takes longer than you think
- Loneliness is real
- Imposter syndrome never fully goes away

## What Actually Helps

1. Ship fast, iterate faster
2. Talk to customers weekly
3. Keep your burn rate low
4. Find one or two peers who understand

## Would I Do It Again?

Absolutely. But with more realistic expectations.
