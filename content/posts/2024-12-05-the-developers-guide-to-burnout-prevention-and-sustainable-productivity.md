# Burnout Prevention for Developers

I've burned out twice. Here's what I learned.

## Warning Signs

- Dreading opening your laptop
- Cynicism about every project
- Physical exhaustion despite sitting all day
- Inability to focus for more than 10 minutes

## Prevention Strategies

### Set Boundaries
- No Slack after 6pm
- Weekends are sacred
- Vacation means actually disconnecting

### Diversify Your Identity
You are not your job. Have hobbies. See friends. Touch grass.

### Learn to Say No
Not every feature is urgent. Not every meeting needs you.

### Take Breaks
Pomodoro technique works. So does a walk around the block.

## Recovery

If you're already burned out:
1. Take time off (more than you think you need)
2. Talk to someone (therapist, friend, mentor)
3. Consider if the job is the problem
