# Building Resilient Systems

Resilience isn't just about handling failures—it's about expecting them.

## The Three Pillars

1. **Redundancy** - Never have a single point of failure
2. **Graceful degradation** - Fail partially, not completely
3. **Observability** - You can't fix what you can't see

## Key Takeaways

Design for failure from day one. Your system will break; the question is how gracefully.
