# REST

Representational State Transfer. Simple in theory, often overcomplicated in practice.

## The Basics

Resources are nouns: `/users`, `/posts`, `/comments`

Actions are HTTP methods:
- `GET /users` - List users
- `GET /users/1` - Get user 1
- `POST /users` - Create user
- `PUT /users/1` - Update user 1
- `DELETE /users/1` - Delete user 1

## That's It

Really. Keep it simple.
