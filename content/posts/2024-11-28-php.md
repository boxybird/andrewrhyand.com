# PHP

Yes, PHP. In 2024. And it's actually great.

## Modern PHP Features

- Typed properties
- Named arguments
- Match expressions
- Enums
- Fibers
- Attributes

## The Ecosystem

- **Laravel** - Best framework in any language
- **Composer** - Solid package management
- **PHPStan/Psalm** - Static analysis that catches bugs
- **Pest** - Testing that's actually enjoyable

## Performance

PHP 8.x with JIT is fast. Really fast. Stop believing the 2010 memes.
